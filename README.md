## More about Beep

Built for serverless environments like Cloudflare Workers, Beep ensures high availability and real-time monitoring for production workloads and critical services.

The Beep Dashboard runs locally, decoupled from the serverless environment. By communicating securely through Cloudflare D1, your admin interface remains completely private and never exposed to the public internet.
